    question: "What is the definition of a resume?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A resume is a concise document that summarizes your work experience,
        education, skills, qualities, and accomplishments. Its used to showcase
        your qualifications to potential employers and helps you stand out. It
        tells employers why you deserve a job interview in one or two powerful
        pages.

    question: "What is the difference between a CV and a resume?",
    answer: (
      <>
        In the U.S. and elsewhere around the world, the terms 'CV' and 'resume'
        are often used in the same way. However, there are some differences. A
        resume is typically shorter, highlighting relevant skills and experience
        for a specific job. A CV (curriculum vitae) is more detailed, focusing
        on your entire career. For most U.S. job applications, a resume is the
        preferred format.

    question: "How do I choose the right resume template?",
    answer: (
      <>
        To choose the right resume template, consider the job you re applying
        for and your industry. If you re in a creative field, a more visually
        appealing template might be best. For traditional industries like
        finance or law, stick to a clean, professional layout. Ensure the
        template is easy to read, highlights your strengths, and aligns with
        your experience level. Avoid overloading it with too many graphics or
        colors that could distract from your qualifications.

    question: "How far back should a resume go?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A resume should typically go back 10-15 years, focusing on the most
        recent and relevant experience, and not necessarily all your previous
        jobs. Older jobs may be summarized briefly or left out if they aren t
        relevant to the position you re applying for. The goal is to highlight
        your most valuable skills and accomplishments without overwhelming the
        reader by making your resume too long.

    question: "What does an ATS-friendly resume mean?",

      <>
        An ATS-friendly resume is designed to pass through the Applicant
        Tracking Systems, which employers use to screen resumes, especially for
        roles with lots of applicants. To make your resume ATS-friendly, use a
        simple, clean format without complex designs or graphics, include
        relevant keywords from the job description, and use standard fonts.
        Avoid tables, images, or unusual file formats, and save your resume as a
        .docx or PDF to ensure compatibility.

        download certain resumes in the .docx file and easily upload them to
        Google Drive, where you can open and edit them in Google Docs. Both

    question: "Is it worth paying for a resume builder?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. Paying for the resume builder offers several advantages. Our free
        resume builder comes with the Vancouver template, and it s a good start
        if you have zero budget. However, paid features unlock professional
        templates, advanced customization, and AI-powered suggestions. All of
        these increase your chances of getting hired. Your job application is
        only as strong as your weakest link. The free features are a great
        starting point, but if you re not getting as many interviews as you
        would like, perhaps its time to make a small investment in your future
        career.

    question: "Should I make a different resume for every job application?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, it s essential to tailor your resume for every job application.
        Tailored resumes are directly relevant to the job description. This
        impresses recruiters. Customize your resume by highlighting the skills,
        experiences, and accomplishments most relevant to the specific job. This
        increases your chances of standing out and showing employers you re a
        great fit for their position. However, you don t need to start from
        scratch; just tweak key sections to match the job description. With our
        resume builder, you can easily duplicate existing resumes, paste the new
        job listing link, and receive tailored advice to help you update your
        resume to match the specific job requirements.
